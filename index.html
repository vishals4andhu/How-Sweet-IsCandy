		<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;"> HISTORY</h2>
		<p>Alpenliebe is a hard candy brand launched by the company Perfetti Van Melle in Europe during the 1970s. The word literally means “Alpine love” in German language and the brand owner company was formed with the merger of two renowned confectionery brands of the world, Perfetti from Italy and Van Melle from Netherland in 2001.</p>
		<p>The world-famous candy came to India in 1995 along with other popular confectioneries of the company. The Indian arm of the company was named Perfetti Van Melle India (PVMI) and its product offerings accounted for about 25% share of the rupees 3,700 Crore non-chocolate confectionery market of the country.</p>
		<p>The European version of the product is sweeter and tastes different than the one in China. So, the key to success of the brand was the attention to local preferences while keeping the core product quality and texture in mind.</p>
